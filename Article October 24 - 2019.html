        <p id="pBookingPos">Nowadays we live in a very busy world and sometimes it feels like we do not have enough time for healthy eating. But let me remind you that this is just an illusion and when people set their priorities right, there is always a way to choose a healthier path. When people are struggling to include some wholesome meals in their diet, there is an option to make a smoothie that comes to a rescue. Smoothie can serve different purposes ‚Äì it could be a fun way to blend a few fruits with your toddler, it‚Äôs a sneaky way to add hidden greens and vegetables into your family‚Äôs diet or a fast way to make a liquid meal on the go. It is super easy - just throw a few ingredients in a blander and there you have a delicious and nutritious drink. Sometimes you have some family members that refuse eating vegetables; no matter what you try they do not enjoy the color or the texture of it. No worries, when you mix in a blander some sweet fruits like bananas, apples or berries you can also add some spinach or other greens, then the sweetness of the fruits will cover up the taste of everything else. As to the green color, it can be changed with bright berries like blueberries, blackberries, raspberries or strawberries. With liquid meals you will need a little more creativity or a good recipe. It is preferable that your breakfast smoothie includes all the main nutrients like complex carbohydrates, protein and good fats, so it gives you enough energy to last until the next time you eat. When your meal has complex carbs aka high fiber content, it will not let the blood sugar jump too high and then suddenly drop low before the lunch time comes. Unfortunately, that is what happens with a lot of popular breakfast options like cereal and muffins that are full of sugar.  Even though fruits have natural sugar, it also has fiber that slows down the blood sugar crush. Protein and good fats are very helpful in that sense too and they help to keep your satiety longer. Besides the main nutrients, it is important that your smoothie has a lot of vitamins and minerals that fill your cells with energy and vitality. That‚Äôs why I like adding a scoop of organic dry powdered greens to my recipe. It is strongly recommended to get organic greens, so that not to add all the pesticides and herbicides to your mixture. Also please make sure that there are no sweeteners added, plain and natural is the best option. This way you can make it sweet just by adding your fruits. Another favourite item of mine to add is hemp hearts. I call them a ‚Äúnutrient powerhouse‚Äù, because they are not only full of protein, good fats and fiber but they also provide calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, folate and some vitamins like A, B, C and E. How amazing is that! Another important ingredient in my smoothie is plant-based protein. For this type of drink, I prefer unsweetened and unflavoured option, so that it doesn‚Äôt taste too sweet, since we will also add some bananas and sweet cherries into this mix. My personal favourite is Botanica ‚ÄúPerfect Protein‚Äù, because of its unique texture, but everyone has his own preferable protein powder that he likes to use. Next ingredient is Oat Milk. The reason why I put it there is the smooth texture that it adds to the smoothie and more importantly its nutritional value. It has some good fats, protein, fiber and Vitamin A, Calcium, a bit of iron, Vitamin D and B12, Riboflavin, Phosphorus and Zinc. Another ‚Äúnutrient powerhouse‚Äù, would you agree? The last ingredient is nut and seed butter. It also brings a very smooth texture and good fats, protein, as well as a little calcium and iron. I am adding a lot of fabulous fats to this drink, because it will help you stay full for a longer period and because we normally underestimate the importance of having good fats in our diet. This smoothie is designed for a generally healthy person, who would like to have a fast and nutritious liquid breakfast on the go. If you have any health concerns or following a certain type of diet, please consult your health care practitioner to make sure this recipe is suitable for you.</p>
