    <h1 class="headerPosition">About</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="parAboutLeft"><p>Marianna Martinez is a Holistic Nutritionist, Metabolic Balance Coach, Energy Medicine Practitioner, and Reiki Master. She is the founder of Marianna Martinez Wellness, a holistic consultation company established in 2013.</p>
        <p>Marianna is dedicated to helping women achieve harmony in their lives by balancing physical health, energy flow, and emotional well-being.</p>
        <p>Having faced her own health challenges, Marianna deeply understands the importance of combining healthy nutrition, exercise, and spiritual growth to create a fulfilling and vibrant life. She resonates with the words of James H. West, who said, “Health is a large word. It embraces not the body only, but the mind and spirit as well; and not today’s pain or pleasure alone, but the whole being and outlook of man.”</p>
        <p>Marianna maintained excellent health throughout her life until she experienced significant weight gain after giving birth to her son in 2015. Despite trying various diets and workout routines, she struggled to regain balance. Her breakthrough came in 2021 when she discovered the Metabolic Balance® program, which helped her lose 25 pounds in just six weeks by eating nutritious, personalized foods.</p>
        <p>Now Marianna is in the best shape of her life - physically, mentally, and emotionally. Reflecting on her journey, she shares:
            “I finally realized the secret to having a beautiful body inside and out - it’s not about age. It’s about what you eat, how you live, and the thoughts you nurture.”</p>
        <p>Marianna’s mission is to empower women to take charge of their health by identifying the root causes of their symptoms and addressing imbalances. She guides her clients toward healthier food choices, lifestyle habits, and mindsets to restore and maintain lasting well-being.</p>
        <p>Passionate about holistic living, Marianna strives to lead others toward a balanced, energized, and fulfilling life.</p>
