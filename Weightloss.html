                <h2>How it all started</h2>
                <p>I had always been in great shape throughout my life. However, after giving birth to my son in 2015, things began to change. Initially, I returned to my pre-pregnancy weight, but once I stopped breastfeeding, I started to gain weight rapidly.</p>

        <div class="myWay">
            <div class="description">
                <h2>My Efforts</h2>
                <p>As soon as I noticed the changes in my body, I joined a gym and committed to regular workouts for over a year. While this helped temporarily slow down further weight gain, I still couldn‚Äôt get back to my pre-pregnancy shape.</p>
                <p>I then experimented with various meal replacement programs and at-home workout routines, but none of them delivered lasting results.</p>
                <p>In the photo on the left, taken in 2020, I was still struggling to lose stubborn belly fat despite my efforts. The photo on the right shows me in 2021, after discovering a permanent solution that completely transformed my body and health.</p>

                <h2>My solution</h2>
                <p>In March 2021, I discovered the Metabolic Balance¬Æ program. After studying it thoroughly and becoming a certified coach, I decided to test it on myself.</p>
                <p>By simply eating healthy, personalized foods tailored to my body‚Äôs needs - and without intense workouts, only light activities - I lost 25 pounds in just six weeks. This approach completely transformed my health and taught me the power of balanced nutrition.</p>
