                <h2>How it all started</h2>
                <p> I was in a great shape all my life until I gave birth to my son in 2015. Even though I went back to my normal weight at first, after I stopped breastfeeding I started to gain a lot of weight.</p>

            <div class="description">
                <h2>My Efforts</h2>
                <p> As soon as I noticed these changes, I signed up for the gym membership and have gone there for at least a year. During that time I was able to temporary slow down the further weight gain, but couldn't go back to my normal shape. Then I tried different programs with meal replacements and home work outs, but that didn't help either. On the picture on the left is myself in 2020 still trying hard to loose that belly.  On the picture on the right is myself after finding a permanent solution in 2021.</p>

                <p> I finally found Metabolic Balance program in March 2021, studied it and became a Coach. Then tried it out on myself and lost 25 pounds in one and a half month, just by eating healthy foods selected for my body and no exercise, just light activities.</p>
