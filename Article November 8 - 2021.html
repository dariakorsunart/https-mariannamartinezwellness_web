    <p id="pBookingPos">Once we get our perfect body on Metabolic Balance Program we often wonder: ‚ÄúHow do I keep that weight off? I like eating healthy, but I also miss my favorite foods. Will I gain all the weight back if I eat something that is not on my meal plan?‚Äù The truth is ‚Äì moderation is the key. Now you know how to eat right to keep your body fit and healthy. Now you can feel your satiety signals. Now you know which foods your body is reacting to in a negative way. Now it is your time to make those decisions about your food choices. This meal plan is not meant to be followed religiously once you reach your desired weight. In Phase 3 and 4 you need to introduce many other foods that were not on your diet . It is preferable that you keep following most of the rules though, they will help you to stay in shape. Some days you will choose to eat something that is not as healthy, some days you will go back to a healthy diet. Whatever you choose it is ok. You should never feel guilty about your choices and enjoy your moments of indulgence. Always keep an eye on your weight and if you do notice that it is starting to go up and reaches the 5 pounds mark, get back to the meal plan to bring the weight back down for a bi. Don‚Äôt forget to exercise and to keep active. Even though we removed the strenuous workouts from the beginning of the diet for a certain reason, remember that movement will keep your body healthy. Praise yourself for an incredible job your have done and enjoy your beautiful new body!</p>
